# VMSGtoCSV
Extracts SMS from VMSG and converts to CSV. This works wiht the VMSG format output by OPPO phones.

These phones convert ASCII Characters to HEX values in the SMS backup file. 

 I will test files more later. At present there is little to no error corection or validation, so results need to be checked to ensure accuracy.
