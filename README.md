# VMSGtoCSV
Extracts SMS from VMSG and converts to CSV. This works with the VMSG format output by OPPO phones.

Takes a file called "sms.vmsg".

These phones convert ASCII Characters to HEX values in the SMS backup file. 

 I will test files more later. At present there is little to no error corection or validation, so results need to be checked to ensure accuracy.
